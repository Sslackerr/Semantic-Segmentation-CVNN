# Semantic-Segmentation-using-CVNN
This repository contains the complete project documentation for a novel complex-valued U-Net architecture designed for semantic segmentation. Our method integrates complex-valued operations with an attention-based feature fusion (AFF) module to enhance spatial understanding and boundary preservation.

This work was submitted as part of the course project for **EE655: Deep Learning for Computer Vision**, under the guidance of **Prof. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula** at **IIT Kanpur**.
